I want to write a program that can do sentiment analysis on US Senator tweets.

For now I've built a way to scrape a website to get twitter handles -> `parse.py`

## TODO:

- Use this data to get party affiliations.
- Do sentiment analysis on a per senator basis
- Aggregate the data to get "Party" sentiment.
- then build a front end to show stuff...idk yet
